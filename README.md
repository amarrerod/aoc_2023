# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 event. Advent of Code is an annual event where programmers sharpen their skills through a series of challenging programming puzzles.

## Structure

Each day's puzzle solution is stored inside the advent_of_code_2023 directory named day_XX where XX is the day number. Inside such directory, you will find:

* \_\_main\_\_.py: The Python script to run all the puzzles.
* day_xx.py: The Python script containing the solution for each day.
* inputs: The directory where all the inputs are stored.
* examples: The directory where all the example inputs (from the website) are stored.
  

README.md: A brief explanation of the solution.
## Running the Solutions
To run a solution, navigate to the directory of the day's solution and run the Python script. For example, to run the solution for Day 1:

```python
    python3 -m advent_of_code_2023.day_1
```

## Testing
Unit tests are included for each day's solution. To run the tests, use the following command:

```python
    pytest
```
